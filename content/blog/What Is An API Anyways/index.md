### An AP...What?

API stands for Application Programming Interface. This sounds like mumbo-jumbo to most people. What kind of Programming? Interface to what? What applications?

My favorite way to think about these are that API's are the waiters of the internet. Most modern softwares exist in two parts. The front-end, which is what the user sees and interacts with, and the back-end, where the data lives, records, and is worked with to do all the neat things we've come to expect from software this decade. An API is a piece of the server that takes the users requests (the order), takes it to the kitchen (the server), and then returns with the meal (the data, action, item, etc). Without API's, users would sit at tables hungry, and kitchens would be full of food with nothing to do.

What this really works out to is that a company or resource works out several URL endpoints that offer up (usually) JSON data, which is then interpreted into an easier to read format once it gets back to the user. If you've ever logged into a site, tried to look up the weather in your area, or used a search bar, you've most likely interacted with an API, you just don't know it.

Which is good! Well-functioning API's are critical to the web, and the better something works, the less the user has to struggle with it.
