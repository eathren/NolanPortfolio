#### Rule 1: Never work for free.

It took me numerous missteps for me to learn this one. While bidding on jobs, I would have prospective 'employers' ask me detailed questions about the design or technology that would make a project go the smoothest. What I did not realize was that these individuals had absolutely no intention of hiring me. What I thought was a potential client that really cared about the best way to move ahead with a contract was instead an individual that was utilizing me as a free skilled consultant.

#### Rule 2: Find your niche.

It can be difficult to compete with the vast market of web developers. You can't throw a stick without hitting a WordPress designer or a brand-new framework dev ( I should know, I was one), and this makes getting started difficult. I found out the importance of finding your niche very early. Follow the news, look at the technologies available, and go from there.

#### Rule 3: Learn to say 'No'.

If a client responds, and what they are saying is vastly different from what you read initially, it's okay to back out or say no. In fact, you don't have to apply to most jobs in the first place. Find what your skill level is, be honest with yourself, and pursue items in that area. You **do not** want to be the guy who is three weeks into the project and suddenly realizes that there is no way for you to finish what you promised. You won't be doing yourself any favors if you go too high above your skill level and your client is left holding scraps when the project is over. Like it or not, as a freelancer your bread and butter is the reviews and connections you get after a successful project. Like so many other aspects of the digital age, not getting 5 stars means that you might as well be getting one, especially for those first few projects. Stay in your comfort area, and expand your skills doing side-projects instead.

#### Rule 4: Trust your instincts.

This rule ties in with the ability to say no, and if you can stay away from some of these jobs, you are better off for it. If your instincts are warning you that there is something off about a job, there probably is. Find something else, and spare yourself a few weeks of pain.

##Rule 5: Get a healthy snack

This rule is a bit different from the others before it. Web development is a sedentary job, and it's worth noting that if you aren't used to the lifestyle, you might find yourself putting on a pound, or ten... or twenty. Find something healthy to snack on instead of other junk to help mitigate some of this damage. I personally have found myself eating dried seaweed and drinking hot tea, sans sugar. The former has the crispness of chips and still salty enough to sate cravings, and the latter is more interesting than water minus all the extra sugar of other drinks.

#### Rule 6: Flat payment? Get paid half up front, have set goals to avoid scope creep

This one is to protect both you and your client. Nobody wants to finish a project and find out the client is stiffing you. The client also doesn't want you to finish for one massive feedback review at the end. Even if the project is almost perfect, spending hours and hours at the eleventh hour going over the website with you is something that most people just don't want to do. Space out the project, set some points where you both can take a step back and see where the project is, and where it is going. It will make it easier in the long run. Also, be sure to remain vigilant for scope creep. Clients will sometimes try to ease some extra work into a flat rate project. If this happens, take a step back and renegotiate. Your time and labor has value. It is okay to charge for that time.

#### Rule 7: Beware certain phrases

In my experience, I have noticed a trend of dangerous phrases that denote a client that is either too difficult to work with, or simply won't pay once the project is complete. My absolute top red flag is anything along the lines of "This won't take an expert very long" on a rush job. Especially if that job is set as seeking an entry level candidate.

#### Rule 8: Charge what you're worth

When I was getting started, I approached my hourly rate like many others did. I took the yearly salary of someone with my experience, and I divided it down to the equal hourly rate. At the time, I hadn't wanted to scare off clients by being too expensive, and thought that undercutting the market was the best way forward. Those first few months were slow. I eventually learned that clients will avoid hiring those whose proposals are too low, just as they avoid those who are charging far too much. In the end, you don't get any benefits like health insurance, and you are going to spend a good chunk of your time chasing down clients. Plan accordingly for these extra costs.

#### Underpromise, Overdeliver

Being the one who over-promises and under-delivers is a bad place to be. Be reasonable in your timelines, add extra time onto the time-line, and be clear in your communication as to where the project is at. There aren't many clients that don't like updates.
