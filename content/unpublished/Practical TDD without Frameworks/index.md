TDD (Test-driven development) is an cornerstone of software and related engineering practices. However, it can be tricky to pull off for those who work in the frontend. This guide will not cover how to test UI with unit tests on the front-end, but it does cover how to set up a solid TDD workflow for our javascript logic. By the end we will go over how to check inputs, if items appended, and a test.js file that will take the imported calculator functions and check them with pre-set values and check them against what we _expect_.
